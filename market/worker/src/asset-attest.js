/**
 * Deployed-asset attestation for the deploy lane.
 *
 * The lane that deploys `market/dist` has to prove that the version it just
 * published serves every path its manifests advertise, with the committed byte
 * count. Measuring that over the public origin fails for part of every run: the
 * zone's own policy on a cloud IP range answers those requests with 403, which
 * says nothing about the asset — the same paths answer 200 with the committed
 * byte lengths from other networks, and the refusal survives every retry inside
 * the run (2026-09-23: the same 150 of 3075 paths, six runs).
 *
 * This route moves the measurement inside Cloudflare: the caller posts the paths
 * it wants measured and gets back what the deployed version's asset layer serves
 * for each one. The measurement is the part that stays inside, not the call: a
 * caller met by the zone's policy on its own vantage never reaches this route,
 * which is why the lane reports such a refusal as the edge's answer rather than
 * as a verdict about the assets (2026-09-24: the first attested run from a
 * runner was challenged, `cf-mitigated: challenge`). It is a read-only
 * measurement of already-public assets, gated on a shared secret because one
 * call makes up to ATTEST_MAX_PATHS internal asset fetches and an open route
 * would be an amplification vector. Nothing here is part of the client-facing
 * API surface, so the route stays out of the API catalog and the OpenAPI
 * description.
 *
 * Fail closed: without the configured secret the route answers 503 rather than
 * serving measurements to anyone.
