# Agent Note: Task Board external provider extension contract

Status: proposed

This proposal partially supersedes [GitHub Issues as Task Board work items with controlled write-back](../../implemented/feature/2026-09-30-task-board-github-issues-integration.md): that note's GitHub endpoint decisions (inbound issue discovery, controlled label write-back, execution immutability, deactivation without loss, Host-side credentials, PR lifecycle, fault isolation) still stand, while the dependency direction and the storage coupling it recorded are replaced by the contract below.

## Problem

The task board inlines GitHub today, and each inlining symptom is a boundary defect that a second provider would multiply.

- **Inverted dependency direction**: the board imports GitHub and constructs `GitHubApiClient` in its own host entry, so the board knows provider vocabulary and cannot be built or reasoned about without it.
- **Pierced storage layer**: `GitHubSyncService` holds the `HostTaskLedger` directly, and the ledger grew provider-specific API (`findTaskByGitHubIdentity`, `updateTaskIntegrations(Partial<GitHubTaskMetadata>)`), so a provider reaches around the board's own authority.
- **Duplicated invariants**: the provider's `shouldRefreshContent` misses `archivedAt`, while the board's `canEditTaskContent` is the correct authority; two implementations of one rule drift.
- **Board-hard-coded provider policy**: card visibility checks `integrations.github.deactivated` directly, and the provider's browser UI (detail section, settings summary, filter haystack) lives in board files.

## Proposal

Define one external provider contract and move GitHub onto it. The contract is the single source of truth; provider packages implement against it and never import board internals.

1. **Services**: the host and the browser halves each publish one cordis service named `taskBoard`; the API version constant is `TASK_BOARD_API_VERSION = 1`. A provider declares the version it was built against; any other version is refused visibly (logged and thrown) without disturbing the board.
2. **Child seats** (board declares, provider registers): `task-board.detail.section` with props `{ task, dispatch }`, `task-board.settings.section` with props `{ dispatch }`, and `task-board.card.decoration` with props `{ task }`. The registering board components declare these keys in `register`'s `children` option and consume them with `renderSlot`, threaded through an internal React context to `TaskDetail`, the card and the settings card. Cross-package providers must not value-import the board; each re-declares the three keys with an identical `declare module` in its own package.
3. **Host capability face** handed to a provider's `TaskBoardExtension`: `tasks.{ list, get, create(draft, { payload, hidden }), patchContent(taskId, { title, description, prompt }), setStatus(taskId, status, initiator), linked() }`; `integration.{ read(taskId), write(taskId, payload) }`; `events.{ onStatusChanged, onExecutionSettled, onTaskDeleted }` (each returns an unsubscribe function); `publish(summary)` (a read-only summary returned to that provider's client half through `snapshot.extensions[id]`); and `registerTool(definition)` (a model-visible tool that registers and disposes with board-enabled x extension-enabled).
4. **Client capability face** (provided by the board's browser half): `dispatch({ extensionId, action, taskId?, payload? })` delivered over the board's same-origin action channel (a provider adds no HTTP surface); `registerVisibility(predicate)` card visibility predicates (replacing the board's hard-coded deactivated check); and `subscribe(cb)` / `snapshot()` over the board's task mirror and published summaries.
5. **Wire and ledger**: `TaskRecord.integrations` becomes an opaque `Record<string, unknown>` validated only as a pure JSON object whose entries are each at most 64 KiB; the three `github-*` action kinds collapse into `{ kind: "extension-action", extensionId, action, taskId?, payload? }`; the snapshot-only `github` field becomes `extensions?: Record<string, unknown>`. No ledger schema migration is performed.
6. **Invariants hoisted to the board**: `patchContent` reuses `canEditTaskContent` (an executed or archived card keeps its recorded content); `setStatus` goes through the board's existing gates (the running lock and the manual column rules); event callback failures are isolated with try/catch and a log, never interrupting execution; and identity indexing belongs to the provider (the board provides no `findTaskByGitHubIdentity`).
7. **Three-state switch precedence**: loader row disabled (needs a restart, the heaviest) beats extension `enabled` (volatile, default true, immediately lazy: stop polling, stop write-back, unregister tools, hide seats, never clear data) beats the board master switch (which silences everything with it).

## Context & Efficiency Impact

The contract adds one small shared types module plus a host registry and a browser service; the board's snapshot gains one optional opaque map and loses one provider-shaped field, so the wire payload is unchanged in size. Providers stop duplicating board rules, and the board's own context no longer names a provider. The registry buffers provider tool definitions so a tool registry that resolves late still adopts them, which costs an array per provider.

## Alternatives considered

**Widen the wire with a provider envelope and migrate the ledger to a typed per-provider schema.** Rejected: a schema migration rewrites durable user data for a boundary that can be expressed additively, and a typed provider slot in the ledger re-couples the board to provider vocabulary — the exact defect this contract removes.

**Let each extension own its own store and have the board hold only task ids.** Rejected: the board must stay authoritative over task lifecycle and execution (Host execution, settlement and deletion must be observable by every provider, and the GUI mirrors one ledger), and an extension-owned store cannot be that single authority.

**Let each extension register its own HTTP routes and have the browser talk to them directly.** Rejected: it multiplies same-origin surfaces and their access control, while the board already owns one guarded same-origin action channel that `dispatch` can reuse.

**Declare the seats as three fixed component props instead of slot registrations.** Rejected: the board would then enumerate providers at build time, so a provider package could not be added by installing it; the child-seat registration keeps the provider set open at runtime.

## Acceptance criteria

The contract tests pass: registration is idempotent by id, a mismatched `apiVersion` is refused with a diagnosable error while the board keeps serving, the board x extension enable gate starts and stops a provider, tools register and unregister with it, one throwing event callback is isolated while healthy callbacks still run, `patchContent` refuses a started card, `setStatus` refuses a card the runner is executing, non-JSON and oversized payloads are refused, and provider actions route back with the opaque payload intact. A fake provider consuming every capability passes, proving the contract is not GitHub-shaped. The existing six `github-*` suites stay green, and `pnpm --filter @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-task-board typecheck` / `test` / `build` pass. Outside the provider's own directories (`src/host/github/**`, `src/core/github/**`, `src/client/github/**`) plus the single assembly in `src/index.ts`, board source contains no GitHub semantics.

## Risks

The client seats collapse with the board's own panel registration, so the provider re-establishes them from the client mirror on every board re-enable; the provider must therefore treat seat registration as idempotent and cheap. Opaque integrations push provider validation into providers: a malformed provider payload no longer drops the ledger row, so a provider must validate its own entry on read. `registerVisibility` predicates run on every board render, so a predicate must stay a cheap pure function of the task. The transitional in-package assembly in `src/index.ts` (and the matching browser assembly) must disappear when the provider package split lands; until then the board namespace still carries the provider's copy, which the provider package's own locale work must take over.
