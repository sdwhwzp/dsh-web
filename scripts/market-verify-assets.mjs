/**
 * market-verify-assets - prove the deployed market actually serves every asset
 * its manifests advertise.
 *
 * The manifests are the contract: the Workshop installs from
 * manifest/<kind>.json, so any path listed there that the site cannot serve is
 * a broken install for a user. This gate walks every listed path and fails on
 * the first mismatch, which makes a partial upload or a stale manifest loud
 * instead of silent.
 *
 * Part of every burst sent from a GitHub runner range comes back 403: the
 * zone's own policy on that vantage answers with a managed challenge, which
 * reports paths the origin serves as missing. Transient statuses are retried
 * inside the burst, and the paths still failing after it are re-checked
 * serially once the burst has stopped, so what the gate reports is a verdict
 * the origin repeats rather than one the burst provoked. No sweep from a runner
 * range completes, which is why the deploy lane measures through the
 * attestation route instead.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/market-verify-assets.mjs [--dist]
 *   node scripts/market-verify-assets.mjs --origin https://dsh-market.com
 *   node scripts/market-verify-assets.mjs --attest https://dsh-market.com
 *   node scripts/market-verify-assets.mjs --kind skins --concurrency 8
 *
 *   --dist            check the local market/dist tree (default)
 *   --origin <url>    check a deployed origin over HTTP
 *   --attest <url>    measure the deployed version through its own asset
 *                     binding (needs MARKET_ATTEST_SECRET); the measurement
 *                     runs inside Cloudflare, while the call itself still
 *                     leaves this vantage
 *   --kind a,b        restrict to skins and/or pets (default: both)
 *   --concurrency N   parallel requests (default 4)
 *   --limit N         stop after N paths (smoke runs)
