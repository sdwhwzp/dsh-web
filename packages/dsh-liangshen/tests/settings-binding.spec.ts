/**
 * Client settings-form binding on the 0.1.7 cohort.
 *
 * A settings form is addressed by profile entry id there, while this card knows
 * only its family namespace: the family binder (dsh-web-settings) is what
 * resolves one onto the other, and the shared configuration forms service is
 * the fallback for a page that serves no binder.
 *
 * The regression this file pins: the fallback used to bind the bare namespace
 * whenever the describe mirror held nothing yet, which is the normal state at
 * plugin activation. The Host serves no entry under that id, so every save
 * answered "No configurable plugin entry liangshen" and the card kept the draft
 * with its "the deployment did not accept these values" notice. A one-shot guess
 * cannot be right for every deployment either (a standalone install's row id is
 * the namespace), so the fallback rebinds when the mirror answers.
