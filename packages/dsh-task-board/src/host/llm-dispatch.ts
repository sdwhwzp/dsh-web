/**
 * One-shot model dispatch for the board's Host half.
 *
 * The board makes two one-shot model calls: the goal-acceptance judge
 * (`verification-runner.ts`) and the "parse pasted text" action
 * (`host-ai.ts`). Both call the official `llm` service, and both must call it
 * the way the official agent loop does.
 *
 * The runtime exposes two entry points with the same name shape. The public
 * `stream(options)` is a single-argument convenience method, and it is an
 * ordinary instance property — any plugin may overwrite it. The registration
 * bound path `prepareCall(config)` returns a one-shot handle whose
 * `stream(request)` reaches the adapter through the runtime's internal
 * dispatch instead, and `ctx.on('llm/stream')` remains the supported seam every
 * extension is expected to register on.
 *
 * A third-party provider plugin that patched `llm.stream` with the waterfall
 * listener signature `(options, next)` broke every caller that used the public
 * method: `llm.stream(options)` invoked the listener with `next === undefined`,
 * so the guard's `for await (const chunk of next())` raised
 * `TypeError: next(...) is not a function or its return value is not async
 * iterable`. The agent loop was unaffected because it already dispatches
 * through `prepareCall(...).stream(...)`; the board's two one-shot calls were
 * not, and each completed acceptance was recorded as an anomaly
 * ("验收异常（裁判请求失败）") after two judge attempts.
 *
 * Dispatching through the prepared call fixes that at the owner: the board no
 * longer depends on a mutable instance property that a plugin may legitimately
 * replace, and a plugin that registers on `llm/stream` is still invoked. The
 * public method remains the fallback for a runtime that exposes no
 * `prepareCall` at all, so an older or proxied service keeps working.
