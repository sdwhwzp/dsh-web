/**
 * npm identity of this plugin. The dsh-web-all degraded ledger is keyed by the
 * real plugin package name of a family row, and this plugin's browser half
 * must name its OWN row there to learn why its Host API is missing (issue
 * #1730): the served bundle cannot derive the name, because a family row
 * mounts the package from a versioned profile path. The host half spells the
 * same name in its single-mount guard (src/index.ts); the two move together.
