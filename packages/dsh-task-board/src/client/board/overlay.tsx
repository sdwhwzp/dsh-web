/**
 * Shared behavior of the board's transient surfaces (the task detail overlay
 * and every modal that opens above it).
 *
 * Two concerns live here because they are one contract:
 *
 * - `usePresence` keeps a surface mounted through its exit leg. The board's
 *   overlays are mounted by a boolean at the call site; the moment that
 *   boolean flips the node would vanish, so the enter animation had no
 *   reverse. Presence turns the boolean into `open` -> `closing` -> gone and
 *   paints the phase on the surface, which is what the CSS transition pair
 *   reads. Dimensions never change across the pair, so nothing around the
 *   overlay reflows.
 * - `useDialog` owns the keyboard and focus contract of a modal surface:
 *   focus moves into the dialog when it opens and returns to the control that
 *   opened it when it closes, Tab cycles inside it, and Escape asks the owner
 *   to close.
 *
