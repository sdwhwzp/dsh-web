/**
 * Graceful shutdown of a mounted board, and provider tool registration against a
 * host that is already going away.
 *
 * cordis marks a fiber UNLOADING before running its disposers, so a tool
 * registration attempted from a disposer is refused with INACTIVE_EFFECT. The
 * board's teardown used to rebind the provider tool registry on its way down,
 * which turned one release into N refused re-registrations: one error line per
 * tool each provider exposes, printed on every clean exit of `dsh web`.
 *
 * The activation test mounts the real plugin entry against a context whose tool
 * registry refuses registration exactly the way an unloading fiber does, so the
 * refusals it counts are the ones a Ctrl+C shutdown produces. The registry tests
 * drive the registry itself with a recording logger, so what the board would
 * have printed is observable without patching the console.
