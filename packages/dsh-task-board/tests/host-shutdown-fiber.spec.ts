/**
 * End-to-end proof against a REAL cordis fiber.
 *
 * host-shutdown-tools.spec.ts drives a context double, so the INACTIVE_EFFECT
 * refusal there is raised by the test. This file drives cordis itself: the
 * board's host half is mounted on a real plugin fiber through the real
 * `Fiber.effect`, a provider contributes its tools while that fiber is live,
 * and the fiber is then disposed exactly as a Ctrl+C shutdown does. The
 * refusal therefore comes from cordis, with the same code the issue reported.
 *
 * The tool service is a scoped proxy bound to the caller's fiber, which is what
 * the real host hands out (`ScopedLayers` / `Proxy.register` in the reported
 * stack): an effect it creates belongs to the plugin that called `register`, so
 * a call made from a disposer is refused by that fiber, not by the provider's.
