 * The board's registrations validated against the REAL slot core.
 *
 * Every other spec in this package drives a fake seats service, so it checks
 * the wiring but not the registry's own rules: that a keyed slot admits one
 * entry per key, that a list entry carries the id/order/label shape its kind
 * requires, and that disposal releases what was registered. This spec runs
 * `registerTaskBoardPanel` against the genuine `SlotCore` the running shell
 * installs, so an option shape the registry rejects fails here instead of in
 * the GUI.

 * core itself validates the option shapes below.
 *
 * The core only admits a registration into a DECLARED seat, so the harness
 * declares the two seats the way the shell does: ui-layout's root entry
 * declares `main` as keyed, and ui-sidebar's declares `sidebar.panellist` as
 * a root-scoped list. Registration through an undeclared seat throws
 * (`slot "..." is not declared`), which is what makes `ctx.slots.inject` the
 * required path in production.
