/**
 * Host-half fault-isolation shell for the dsh-web family aggregate.
 *
 * The DSH loader mounts every patch row as a transactional loader entry: one
 * entry that fails to import or start rolls the whole group back and the boot
 * audit (`assertEntriesActivated`) kills the entire `dsh web` process — one
 * broken plugin takes every plugin down. This shell redefines the fault unit:
 * each family plugin's patch row points at THIS package (a module that never
 * fails to import) and carries the real plugin package name in its row config.
 * The shell imports the real module at start time; an import or activation
 * failure is captured, logged, and recorded — the shell fiber itself stays
 * active, so the boot audit sees a healthy entry and the rest of the family
 * mounts regardless.
 *
 * The real plugin runs as a nested plugin on the shell's child context, which
 * keeps cordis semantics intact: services it provides stay visible through the
 * normal scope chain, its lifecycle (config updates, disposal) tracks the
 * shell entry, and a later failure retracts only its own services.
 *
 * Config contract (written by scripts/aggregate.mjs, then edited by the Host
 * settings surface):
 *   - id: web-ui-task-board
 *     name: '@linxin666/dsh-web-all/task-board'
 *     config:
 *       plugin: '@linxin666/dsh-client-ui-task-board'
 *       (the real plugin's own config fields, at the row config root)
 *
 * `plugin` is the shell's own key; every other key of the row config IS the
 * real plugin's config, forwarded verbatim. The flattened shape is what makes
 * the row configurable: the Host settings surface edits an entry's own Config
 * schema, so the family plugin's fields must sit where a standalone install of
 * that package keeps them — one shape whether a profile mounts the aggregate
 * row or the package on its own. See {@link Config}.
 *
 * The aggregate's SELF row (web-ui-compat) mounts this package with NO
 * config: that is the compat shim's own mount (its host half is a no-op and
 * its browser half rides the package's ./client face), so a config-less row
 * is accepted as a no-op rather than treated as a mis-generated row.
 *
 * Health surface: a loopback-only GET /api/dsh-web-all/degraded answers with
 * the current degradation ledger so doctor/monitoring can surface "these
 * plugins are degraded, the rest of the Web is healthy" without log scraping.
 *
 * Row-state surface: GET /api/dsh-web-all/rows answers the active family rows
 * (real plugin package names, see src/rows.ts) so the browser half can gate
 * which folded client children mount (#1372): a row disabled through a user
 * patch override never applies its shell entry, and its settings tabs stay
 * off the page. Unlike the degraded route this one is NOT loopback-fenced —
 * remote browsers (remote-web-ui) read it same-origin like every other family
 * /api route; it only leaks active family package names, which the served
 * client bundle already reveals.

 * cannot declare those fields: it would have to import the family module to

 * exists to contain. Two properties of this stand-in make the real fields
 * editable anyway:
 *
 * - `any` (not an object) keeps them at the form root: an object schema
 *   projects only its own declared keys, and every family card would read
 *   empty values.
 * - `.volatile()` is what puts the entry on the settings surface at all
 *   (`SettingsForms.describe` skips an entry with no volatile field) and what
 *   admits a write to any path. It also moves the edit to the live path: the
 *   Loader commits the new config into this entry's reference instead of
 *   remounting the row, and {@link apply} mounts the family plugin again with
 *   the committed config.
 *
 * The accepted cost: the Host cannot validate family fields at write time. The
