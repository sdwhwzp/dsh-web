/**
 * Restart planning and execution for the plugin-manager gateway.
 *
 * The plugin page's restart action exists to make an applied plugin update
 * effective, which means the DSH host process must come back with the new
 * packages loaded. How that is achieved depends entirely on who launched this
 * process, and the host can only tell that from its own facts:
 *
 * - A packaged Desktop launch (the Electron shell's child process, see
 *   isPackagedDesktopArgv / ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE) cannot be relaunched by a
 *   plugin: Electron owns the process tree, and anything this process spawns
 *   would fight the shell for the same port while Electron reports the host as
 *   crashed. The plugin therefore stops the host and lets the shell run the
 *   restart it already owns (app.relaunch(), the same recovery action the
 *   Desktop app offers after installing a downloaded update). Mode 'shell'.
 * - A host this plugin can prove is a terminal launch (an interactive stdio
 *   pair, no Electron in the environment) is restarted in place: a detached
 *   helper waits for this process to exit and re-executes the same command
 *   line, so the port is free before the replacement binds it. Mode 'relaunch'.
 * - Everything else — a supervisor-managed launch with piped stdio, a shell
 *   this plugin cannot identify — is left alone: the route answers 'manual'
 *   and this process keeps running rather than dying with no replacement.
 *   Mode 'manual'.
 *
 * The decision is pure ({@link planRestart}) so the modes are testable without
 * spawning anything; {@link performRestart} is the effectful half.
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-plugin-manager/host
