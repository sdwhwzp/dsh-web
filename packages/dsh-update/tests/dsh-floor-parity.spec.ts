/**
 * The update panel and the plugin manager compatibility gate must read the
 * same DSH floor out of one registry manifest (#1767).
 *
 * They cannot share one function: a cross-package value import is forbidden
 * and the shared/ mirror carries fixed files rather than arbitrary modules, so
 * each package keeps its own reader. That is only safe while the two agree on
 * every shape a manifest can take, which is what this file pins.
 *
 * The floor that matters most is peerDependencies on the host package: a
 * package that declares the host only there still gets its row skipped at
 * boot, so a reader that ignored it would leave the user with no warning.
 *
 * test-standards-allow: pure-function parity over synthetic registry manifests
