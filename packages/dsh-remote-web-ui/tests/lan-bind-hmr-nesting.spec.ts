/**
 * Issue #1751: saving a remote-web-ui setting failed with "HMR transactions
 * cannot be nested".
 *
 * The Host runs settings/mutate inside hmr.runExclusive. Committing a volatile
 * field announces loader/volatile-update, which drove sync() synchronously on
 * that same async context, and sync() wrote cordis.patch.yml - the file the HMR
 * config watcher refreshes from. The watcher's refresh then re-entered
 * runExclusive and rejected, which surfaced as the user's save failing.
 *
 * The regression is a placement rule, so the test asserts it directly: the
 * patch write and the blocking firewall probes live in applyLanBindWork, which
 * only ever runs from a setImmediate hop, and sync() itself reaches them
 * solely through scheduleLanBindWork().
