/**
 * Browser-half installer for the GitHub provider.
 *
 * A provider's browser half registers its own contributions into the child
 * seats the board declares; it resolves the board's client capability face from
 * the shared service name and adds no HTTP surface of its own. Two switches
 * compose here:
 *
 * - the BOARD's master switch collapses the seats (the board mirror reports it,
 *   and the board's own registrations collapse with them);
 * - this EXTENSION's own volatile switch hides the seats entirely, without a
 *   restart, because the installer follows the settings form the card edits.
 *
 * The board's browser half publishes its `taskBoard` service inside its own
 * apply, and the aggregate mounts its client children without ordering those
 * applies, so the service is frequently NOT there yet when this installer runs.
 * The seats therefore live behind a cordis dependency scope (`ctx.inject`)
 * instead of a one-shot lookup: the scope mounts once the board serves the
 * service and unloads — releasing every seat — when the board withdraws it.
 * A one-shot "resolve, give up, never retry" lookup is what made the seats
 * permanently absent under a real aggregate load.
 *
