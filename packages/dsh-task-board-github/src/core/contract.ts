/**
 * Same-shape restatement of the task board's external-provider contract.
 *
 * The board owns this contract (`packages/dsh-task-board/src/core/extension.ts`)
 * and this package may not import the board's internals, so every type and
 * constant the extension consumes is restated here with an identical shape and
 * resolved at runtime through the shared cordis service name. Nothing in this
 * module is a value import of a board package: the declarations are erased and
 * the service lookup is a plain property read.
 *
 * Two halves resolve the same service name, exactly as the board documents:
 * the host half types it as {@link TaskBoardHostFace} (declared below), and the
 * browser half narrows it through {@link resolveTaskBoardClientFace}.
 *
 * @module dsh-task-board-github/core/contract
