  <strong>GitHub Issues & PR Bidirectional Sync Extension for DeepSeek Harness (DSH) Task Board</strong><br>
  <em>Issue to Task Card · Bidirectional Status Sync · Automated PR Creation · Agent Delivery · 7 Agent Tools</em>
</p>

An official external provider extension for the DeepSeek Harness (DSH) Web GUI and desktop client task board (`@linxin666/dsh-task-board`). It seamlessly bridges GitHub Issues and automated DSH agent workflows: selected issues from configured repositories are ingested into task cards, driving autonomous agent execution, automatic pull request creation, and bidirectional status synchronization. It features GUI credential controls and mounts via `cordis.patch.yml` and profiles without modifying DSH source code.

## Features

- **GitHub Issues as an external board source**: every configured repository contributes the issues it selects; the board keeps owning the columns, execution and scheduling.
- **Per-repository configuration**: owner, repository, inclusion label, an optional inclusion assignee, whether unassigned issues are included, managed label prefix, the GitHub label behind each board column, the pull-request phase label, the poll interval, pull-request creation, the draft policy, close-on-merge and the pull-request base branch.
- **Three ways onto the board**: an issue is included when it carries the inclusion label, when it is assigned to the repository's configured login (`@me` for the account the host is authenticated as), or when it belongs to a repository that takes unassigned issues and nobody is assigned to it at all. An issue that loses every channel is deactivated without losing its history.
- **The unassigned channel**: `includeUnassigned: true` matches only issues with no assignee whatsoever and never takes an issue assigned to somebody else. It suits repositories that manage their issues by label alone and assign nothing.
- **Controlled write-back**: only DSH-owned state and phase labels are added or removed. Repository labels, including the inclusion label itself, are never modified.
- **Execution immutability**: remote title and body refresh a card's content only until the card starts executing. The board's own content gate settles that, and the extension keeps no second opinion about which cards are frozen.
- **Deactivation without loss**: an issue that stops being selected (the label went away and it is no longer assigned to the configured login) hides its card from the active board and keeps every execution; selecting it again restores the same card.
- **Seven model-visible tools**: the five synchronization tools (`task_board_github_list`, `task_board_github_get`, `task_board_github_refresh`, `task_board_github_create_pr`, `task_board_github_link_pr`) and two configuration tools (`task_board_github_setup`, `task_board_github_repositories`), contributed through the board's `registerTool` capability, so they follow the board's master switch AND this extension's switch.
- **Two board seats**: a task-detail section for the issue, its labels and its pull request, and a compact `#<issueNumber>` card decoration. The repository and credential summary renders in this extension's own settings card, beside the switches that govern it.
- **One switch gates both halves**: on by default. Turning it off stops polling, write-back, the event subscriptions and the tool registrations, clears the published summary and hides the seats — without remounting the row and without touching stored cards.
- **Board-owned registration, independent of load order**: the extension registers into the task board's provider surface and imports no task-board internals, so it builds, publishes and loads as a package of its own. Both halves wait for the board's service through a cordis dependency scope, so the board may activate before or after this row: the seats and the provider registration appear as soon as the service is served, and are released when it is withdrawn.
- **Host-side credential handling**: the token is resolved on the host — the harness credential store first (the same store the Models page writes API keys into), then the environment variable named by `tokenEnv`, then `GH_TOKEN`. The settings card and the setup tools write it once; no reply, snapshot or tool result carries its value. Remote issue text is stored as card content and provider metadata only; it never reaches a permission, a workspace identity or a `promptPrefix`.

## Install

Install the aggregate bundle or this package alone, then restart `dsh web`:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-task-board-github@latest
```

For local development:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-web.git
cd dsh-web
pnpm install
pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add link:$(pwd)/packages/dsh-task-board-github
```

## Configure it in the GUI

Open the Web GUI settings and find the **GitHub Issues sync** card. Everything a normal setup needs is configured in place, with no profile patch and no restart:

1. **Paste a GitHub token** into the credential field and save it. The token goes to the local host once and is stored in the DSH credential store — the same store the Models page writes API keys into — and the browser never reads it back. A fine-grained token with repository read access (contents, issues and pull requests) is enough. A deployment that would rather keep the token out of the store can export `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or another name through `tokenEnv`) or `GH_TOKEN` instead; the card reports which source is in use and whether the store can be written at all.
2. **Add the repositories to synchronize**: type `owner/repo`, paste a GitHub URL or an SSH remote, and optionally name the inclusion label each repository uses plus an inclusion assignee. An issue becomes a board card when it carries that label, is assigned to that login, or — for a repository whose unassigned channel is on — has no assignee at all — put `@me` in the assignee field to follow your own assignments, which is the easy way to pull in the issues you are working on without labeling anything; for a repository that assigns nothing, press that row's take-unassigned button to also collect the unassigned backlog.
3. **Test the connection**: the card reports the authenticated account and, per repository, whether it is reachable and how many open issues carry the inclusion label.

The same setup can be delegated to an agent: `task_board_github_setup` stores or clears the credential and runs the connection test, and `task_board_github_repositories` lists, adds, removes and updates repositories. A token passed as a tool argument becomes part of that conversation, so prefer the settings card where you can reach it.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch for the extension; the settings card writes it in place and both halves follow it immediately. |
| `announceToAgent` | `false` | Opt-in: when true, the extension announces itself in agent system prompts. |
| `tokenEnv` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Credential reference the token is resolved under: the name it is stored under in the credential store, or the environment variable holding it. |
| `repositories` | `[]` | Repositories to synchronize, each with `owner`, `repository`, `inclusionLabel`, `assignee` (`@me` for this host's account), `includeUnassigned` (whether to also collect issues nobody is assigned), `managedLabelPrefix`, `stateLabels`, `prPhaseLabel`, `pollingIntervalMs`, `prCreationEnabled`, `draftPrPolicy`, `closeIssueOnMerge` and `baseBranch`. |

Every key is volatile, which is what lets the settings card, the setup tools and the profile patch all write it: a saved change reaches the running provider without remounting the row. The card itself renders the credential line, the repository list and the connection test; it reads them from this extension's own host routes, which answer loopback requests only. The read-only summary the running provider publishes (configured repositories and credential presence) still rides the board's own state channel and is what the card falls back to when the host routes are unreachable.

## Migrating from the task board row

Until the migration, the GitHub settings lived on the task board's own row as `githubTokenEnv` and `githubRepositories`. The task board no longer declares them: a profile that still carries them does not fail (the board's schema passes unknown keys through), but the values silently stop having any effect because nothing reads them any more.

Move both keys onto this package's row and rename them:

```yaml
- id: web-ui-task-board-github
  name: '@linxin666/dsh-client-ui-task-board-github'
  config:
    tokenEnv: GITHUB_TOKEN        # was githubTokenEnv on the task board row
    repositories:                  # was githubRepositories on the task board row
      - owner: deepseek-ai
        repository: dsh
        inclusionLabel: dsh
        prCreationEnabled: true
```

The switch defaults (`enabled: true`, `announceToAgent: false`) are the same on both rows.

## Security model

This fork exposes shared GitHub repositories and credentials only on standalone hosts. Account-isolated deployments refuse this extension’s setup API, tools, polling and write-back; their per-account task boards never inherit shared Host credentials.

## Known limitations

- A repository entry must name both `owner` and `repository`; an invalid entry fails the row's activation instead of silently skipping that repository.
- The extension only contributes while the task board is installed and enabled; on its own it configures GitHub access and nothing else.
- Turning the extension off does not delete board cards that were synchronized before, because the board owns its ledger.
- A repository whose poll interval is `0` is synchronized on demand only (a manual refresh, a status change or an execution settlement) and never on a timer.

## Build and test

Node 22.19 or newer and the official NPM SDK packages are required; no DSH source checkout is used.

```sh
pnpm --filter @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-task-board-github typecheck
pnpm --filter @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-task-board-github test
pnpm --filter @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-task-board-github build
