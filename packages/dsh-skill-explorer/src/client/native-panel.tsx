/**
 * Native panel registration for the skill center.
 *
 * The panel is an official-style center-column page, not a DOM takeover: it
 * contributes a row into the sidebar shell's own global panel list
 * (`sidebar.panellist`) and its page into the layout's keyed `main` slot. The
 * shell then owns the row box, the label, the active highlight, the collapsed
 * rail and the panel switch, exactly as it does for the shipped Plugins and
 * Schedule pages and for the task board.
 *
 * Both registrations go through `ctx.slots.inject`, which fires only once the
 * owning shell entry has declared the seat: load order between this plugin and
 * ui-layout / ui-sidebar therefore does not matter, and neither does a shell
 * that cannot serve the seats (the callback simply never runs).
 *
